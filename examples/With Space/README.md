Test for two bugs

* https://github.com/akashacms/pdf-document-construction-set/issues/43 -- Image file with a space in the file name is not rendered correctly
* https://github.com/akashacms/pdf-document-construction-set/issues/42 -- Workspace is in a directory path where an element has a space in the directory name

The first is replicated at this moment.  The second is not replicated.
