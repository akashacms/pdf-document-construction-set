#### Why Markdown/AsciiDoc versus Libre Office or other word processor? {.card-title}

Libre Office and other word processor applications are the traditional way to produce PDF documents.  They tend to do an excellent job, especially when one learns the art of template wizardry. {.card-text}

Both Markdown and AsciiDoc use simple text files, along with markup for various effects.  The markup available in both is limited, but cover a large portion of what is needed to produce documents. {.card-text}

The 80% rule has made Markdown a popular choice for technical projects using source code control systems like Git.  As simple text files, Markdown and AsciiDoc are both easy to store in Git, or other systems, alongside our code. {.card-text}

#### Bridging the gap from easy-to-edit to great-PDF-production {.card-title}

PDF Document Maker makes it possible to transition from an 80% solution to a 95% (or more) solution.  It starts with Markdown and AsciiDoc files, for an easy editing experience. {.card-text}

A curated set of Markdown extensions improve the fidelity of the generated HTML. {.card-text}

Excellent diagramming support using PlantUML or Mermaid is easy. {.card-text}

With CSS it is possible to create top-notch customized visual effects. {.card-text}

The Mahabhuta server-side DOM processing engine lets us create custom HTML tags or custom DOM manipulation. This creates an endless realm of possibilities.  For example, it is easy to extract information from an OpenAPI specification, JSON schema, formatting data from either into tables describing API endpoints, data types, and more. {.card-text}

#### Easily reuse documentation between a PDF, and online {.card-title}

PDF Document Maker is based on AkashaCMS, a static website content management system.  The content files used in a PDF Document Maker project can easily be used in an AkashaCMS website project. {.card-text}

For example, the [PDF Document Maker guide](./guide/guide.html) (online version) is also available in [PDF](./guide/guide.pdf). {.card-text}
